# Alien_Invasion
Alien Invasion is a very simple game by modern standards, but it was a technological marvel in its time. Typical levels consist of a player piloting a laser cannon to battle columns of descending aliens while dodge the alien fires. The speed of the alien approach increases as the game progresses, adding to the tension. A bonus appears from time to time, which offers the player an opportunity to gain special powers.
